A collection of IPython Notebooks for teaching Python.
---

This is a fork from the IPython Notebooks [intro_programming](https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming) from [Eric Matthes](https://github.com/ehmatthes). There is a [syllabus](http://www.introtopython.org) of the original course.

Lesson Setup
---

The goal of this fork is to provide course material hosted as IPython Notebooks from a local Network (LAN) and thus give each student a fast way to work on the lessons. 

The files are saved read-only, like this anyone can work on the exercises without interfering with each other.
